			<h2>Peanut Butter Pie</h2>

			<p>Before moving to the U.S. from Serbia for high school, I had never seen or had peanut butter. I didn’t even understand what it was, but I remember seeing it in countless movies and dreaming of trying a PB&J sandwich.

                One day, shortly after moving to Indiana, still jet-lagged and waking up far too early, I was hungry for breakfast and stumbled across a jar of Skippy. Two problems: I had no clue what the J in PB&J stood for, and a sandwich with “butter” back home meant some sort of cured meats, pickles, and maybe ketchup and cheese.
                
                Guided by that notion, I also grabbed Wonder bread and Kraft singles (also new to me), along with ketchup, relish, and the only cured meat I could find — hot dogs — and I made myself a sandwich. I’ll let you imagine what that tasted like.
                
                Months later, someone made me a proper all-American PB&J sandwich and I started appreciating peanut butter in sweet applications. This luscious peanut butter pie has no hot dogs or relishes, but is packed with peanut flavor. Plus, it’s so easy to make that you can whip it up in less than 20 minutes. </p>
